# DAN-Domestic Appliance Network


The website that I have created is my first milestone project at the Code Institute. This website was created for my Fatherâ€™s future local business. My father - Daniel is an electrician that specializes in kitchen appliance repair. I thought it would be a great idea to build him a website in order to promote his services that will be available across Dublin area.

Domestic appliance network is not yet in operation. Some details in the website are not real. In the future the site will be populated with my fathers content such as pictures and videos of his work along with possibly more additional services available. 

Please find a live demo of Domestic Appliance Network website below:

## UX

The aim of this website was to provide an instant and useful information for customers that need to repair their domestic appliances. To benefit the clients the service number is visible at the first glance at the webpage as it is situated on the right-hand side of the nav bar. This number acts as a tool for quick contact to book an appointment, buy new appliances or install. 
Also, the site was constructed in such a way to highlight other services that DAN provides such as delivery and installation. 

The main colour used throughout the website is pastel blue in different shades. I believe that this set of colours resembles cleanliness that domestic appliances give us. 
In the section about us there is an image of Dan working on the mashing machine with his repair tools near him. I feel this picture helps potential customers to view his business as thrustworthy friendly and reliable as this is what they will actually see at their own homes. Dan is happy to show his face to the public as he is proud of his work.  

Map of Dublin was placed in this website to help potencial customers visualise the area DAN is operating in. 

## Features 

### Home page:
The main focus of the home page is the company's name, it consists of a brief introduction on what the business promise to deliver to its customers. The image behind is showing a washing machine, dryer and ovens in a clean kitchen environment. These are infact the main kitchen appliances that DAN repairs daily. The clean kitchen enviromenment is portraying an ideal laundry space that DAN would like to deliver to its customers. There is also a 20% discount button to encourage customers to choose DAN over other similar companies.

### About Us: 
The about us section provides a deeper description of the business and some background information, highlighting the main features. There is a visible picture of Daniel himself repairing a washing machine. I believe this picture creates a feeling of thrust and openess towards the company. Also, to emphasize where DAN operates there is a small map of Dublin in this section. This map can help its potential customers to visualize and assess if DAN can reach them. 


### Services:
This section highlights the main types of services Domestic Appliance Network provides. The logo that is attached to each service type provides extra visual description.

The pictures used in this section are taken from pinterest. In the future these characters will be replaced with real people expressing their opinions and describing their experience with DAN.
