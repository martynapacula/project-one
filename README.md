# DAN-Domestic Appliance Network


The website that I have created is my first milestone project at the Code Institute. This website was created for my Fatherâ€™s future local business. My father Daniel is an electrician that specializes in kitchen appliance repair. I thought it would be a great idea to build him a website in order to promote his services that will be available across Dublin area.

Domestic appliance network is not yet in operation. Some details in the website are not real. In the future the site will be populated with my fathers content such as pictures and videos of his work along with possibly more additional services available. 

Please find a live demo of Domestic Appliance Network website below:

## UX

The aim of this website was to provide an instant and useful information for customers that need to repair their domestic appliances. To benefit the clients the service number is visible at the first glance at the webpage as it is situated on the right-hand side. This number acts as a tool for quick contact information. 
Also, the site was constructed in such a way to highlight other services that DAN provides such as delivery and installation. 

The main colour used throughout the website is pastel blue in different  shades. I believe that this set of colours resembles cleanliness that domestic appliances give us. 

## Features 

### Home page:
The main focus of the home page is the contact number for the services and a brief introduction on what the business promise to deliver to its customers. The image behind is showing clean and neat clothes and clean washing machine portraying an ideal laundry space that DAN would like to deliver to its customers. There is also a 20% discount button to encourage customers to choose DAN over other similar companies. 

### Services:
This section highlights the main types of services Domestic Appliance Network provides. The logo that is attached to each service type provides extra visual description.  

### About Us: 
The about us section provides a deeper description of the business and some background information, highlighting the main features. Also, to emphasize where DAN operates there is a small map of Dublin in this section.

### Do it Yourself (DIY): 
Do it Yourself section acts as a media section in the project. This section is aiming to help the customers and encourage them to fix easy problems themselves by watching a video and listen to the podcast.   

### Testimonials:
This section is dedicated to customers opinions describing their experience with Domestic Appliance Network. At the moment these are fictional characters. The pictures used in this section are stock images. This will change to real characters in the future.
